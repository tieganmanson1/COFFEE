<h3>Garden fertilizer</h3>
<p>
  Even if composting is not your bag, your garden can still benefit from used java.
  Coffee grounds are a great source of nitrogen, which is an essential nutrient for nearly all plants.
  Even though we tend to think of coffee as being an acidic drink, the grounds themselves have a pH level that is close to neutral, making them a great fertilizer.
  Test a given plant is tolerance by adding just one tablespoon of coffee grounds around its base once a week; gently mix the grounds into the topsoil each time.
  If your greenery responds well, try gradually upping the dose until you stop seeing improvement.
  Consult <a href="http://homeguides.sfgate.com/plants-shrubs-like-coffee-grounds-45743.html">this guide</a> for a list of sprouts that are particularly keen on coffee grounds.
